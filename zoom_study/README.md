## Analyzing teams Meeting Characteristics and Performance from Packet Captures

[![build-test](https://github.com/Princeton-Cabernet/teams-analysis/actions/workflows/build-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Princeton-Cabernet/teams-analysis/actions/workflows/build-test.yml)

This repository contains tools to analyze various performance-related metrics of teams meetings
solely from packet traces of teams traffic. The tools allow inferring the types of media (audio,
video, screen share) used, media bit rates, video frame rates and frame sizes, user participation
(muted, speaking, silent), and network-related metrics such as frame-level jitter and overall latency
from *.pcap* data captured using, for example, Wireshark. We also provide a [Wireshark plugin](wireshark) to
analyze teams traffic interactively using the Wireshark UI.

The techniques used to extract these metrics and make inferences based on them are described in our paper:

### Build Project

* Prerequisites: gcc, cmake, pkg-config, wget, and libpcap
    * Under Ubuntu, run `apt-get install cmake g++ libpcap-dev pkg-config wget`

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

### Run Unit Tests

```
(cd build && make test)
```

### Demo

This distribution includes a small (5 min) data set that contains two teams media streams. Use the
analysis scripts and Makefile in [*/data*](data) to generate a set of reports and plots describing
this  data.

### Applications

#### teams_flows

Extracts packets associated with teams and prints per-flow statistics.
* reads all files in directory in lexicographical order of file names if *-i* is a directory path
* writes flow-level statistics to CSV if *-f* specified
* writes Teams type statistics to CSV if *-t* specified
* writes Teams-related packets to PCAP if *-p* specified
* generates time series of packet and byte rate in 1s buckets if *-r* specified
* writes records for Teams packets to custom binary format if *-z* specified
* only considers/filters P2P and STUN packets if *-2* specified (flow summary will still include all flows)

```
usage: teams_flows [OPTION...]
  -i, --in IN.pcap or IN/  input file/path
  -f, --flows-out OUT.csv  flow summary output file (optional)
  -t, --types-out OUT.csv  type summary output file (optional)
  -p, --pcap-out OUT.pcap  filtered pcap output file (optional)
  -r, --rate-out OUT.csv   rate time series output file (optional)
  -z, --zpkt-out OUT.zpkt  Teams packets binary output file (optional)
  -2, --p2p-only           only process STUN and P2P packets (optional)
  -h, --help               print this help message
```

#### teams_rtp

Collects statistics about RTP streams in Teams traffic.
* reads the *.zpkt* input file at the path specified by *-i*
* writes RTP-stream-level statistics to CSV if *-s* specified
* writes a detailed packet log to CSV if *-p* specified
* writes frames to CSV if *-f* specified
* writes performance-related statistics in 1s intervals to CSV if *-t* specified

```
usage: teams_rtp [OPTION...]
  -i, --in IN.zpkt           input file
  -s, --streams-out OUT.csv  output path for stream summary (optional)
  -p, --pkts-out OUT.csv     output path for packet log (optional)
  -f, --frames-out OUT.csv   output path for frame log (optional)
  -t, --stats-out OUT.csv    output path for 1s statistics (optional)
  -h, --help                 print this help message
```

#### teams_meetings

Groups packets by media streams and meetings.
* reads the *.zpkt* input file at the path specified by *-i*
* writes the set of unique (non-duplicate) media streams to CSV if *-u* specified
* writes meetings to CSV if *-m* specified

```
usage: teams_meetings [OPTION...]
  -i, --in IN.zpkt                 input file name
  -u, --unique-out STREAMS.csv     unique streams out file name (optional)
  -m, --meetings-out MEETINGS.csv  meetings out file name (optional)
  -h, --help                       print this help message
```
